When launched, the app will automatically load the `boot.rom` in this directory.
Currently, it is the launcher rom found here: https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/projects/software/launcher.tal.

The assets directory in the apk will be automatically made available to the file device as the root directory.
To test this, copy a few ROMs here and build the app yourself.
