# rom2exe - Turn a ROM into a standalone executable

rom2exe embeds a ROM into an emulator, creating a standalone executable.
Either the GUI or the CLI runner can be chosen using the `-runner=` flag.

On [cosmo](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan), the result is an actually portable executable, working on multiple platforms.
